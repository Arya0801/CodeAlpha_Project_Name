# CodeAlpha_Project_Name
The first project is Credit Scoring Model in which I used logistic regression as the classification algorithm and evaluates the model's performance on the testing data by calculating accuracy, displaying a classification report, and showing the confusion matrix.

The second project is Hand written character recognition in which I used CNN. 

The third project is Disease Prediction from Medical Data for which I used simple logestic regression.
